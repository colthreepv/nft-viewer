# nft-viewer

The project requires:

- node 18.x LTS
- yarn

Install dependencies with `yarn` then run:

- `yarn dev` to start development mode, and open a browser to http://localhost:3000

Tests can be run with:

- `yarn test`

# Functionality missing that would have liked to try

- ‚ùå wrapper for next/image to have a smoothed image preloaded on page open  
  It's overcomplicated to include `next-placeholder` in this demo project
